## Overview

**BabbleWords!** is a simple word building game like "Scrabble".

The game involves arranging words on a board from drawn letter tiles.\
Each letter has a certain number of points. After arranging a word on the board, the player gets as many points as the sum of the letter points in the arranged word + multiplication from the board.
Initially, we plan to do multiplayer gameplay in the form of passing the phone to each other in real life.
Later in future development we plan to create online version on multiple devices.

## Requirements

**BabbleWords!** is a Flutter application; therefore it can run on any mobile device.
